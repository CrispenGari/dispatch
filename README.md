### Idea

The idea behind dispatch app is very simple. Users of the app will be able to recieve notifications or feed post known as `tweets`. These tweets can be created by any user and the user that are in that location radius can read these tweets. During tweet creation users are also able to set tweet `polls` which allows other users to interact with their tweets by voting.

Other users that are not the creator of the tweets can interact with tweets by doing the following:

1. `liking`
2. `viewing`
3. `polling`
4. `commenting`

For all the comments users are able to respond or reply to comments on each `tweet` also mention users on the `comments` and `replies`. Users can also react to comments and `replies` to improve user interactivity.

### How is dispatch different from twitter (X)?

> Problem statement: `Twitter is a great platform for news feed globally. As a well known platform although there are algorithms that caters for feeding users with "tweets of interest" it lacks filtering based on location.`

- Dispatch was build to solve the problems of:
  1. tweets filtering based on location radius (get only news within your city).
  2. notify all users that are using the app about new topics in the city.
